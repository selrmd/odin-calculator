My solution to The Odin Project <b>Calculator<b> Project<br>
<br>
The hardest project in the program so far. Had too many edge cases that caused lots of bugs.<br>
I wish I've done it without using a single object, but I had a hard time with functions scope, so
using objects was the best solution for me rather than using global variables. <br>
Tried my best to make it modular and readable, but it can be confusing when reaching the RegEx part.<br>
I'm happy with my solution, even though I know there is a better, less complicated way to do it. I'll do a V2 once I learn more.<br>
